# Discord.js-Stopwatch Infomration 

This is a basic stopwatch command I made, it pretty much allows users to start a stopwatch and when they stop the stopwatch it gives them the amount of time. In order for the command to work you have to do the following;
**[PREFIX]stopwatch start

**[PREFIX]stopwatch stop

start - Starts the stopwatch

stop - Stops the stopwatch
